The terminal is one of the least beginner-friendly apps. There are no familiar
buttons or menus, no helpful guides, no short videos describing the product. In
fact, most terminals will open with a single `$` in an otherwise empty window.

The most difficult part about starting to use the terminal, though, is that it
does not have a specific purpose. For example, we saw the `date` command
earlier. Your computer almost certainly has a newer, better way of displaying
the time to you. So while the terminal __can__ show you the date, it is not a
very compelling use case.

Unfortunately, this is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. The terminal is the
best way to learn about some of the computer's internals, but until you want to
work with those internals, the terminal does not seem useful.

We are going to take a quick dive into your computer and then regroup once we
have a better sense of what we are working with.
