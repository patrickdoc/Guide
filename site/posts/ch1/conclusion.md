title: "What's Next?"
---

We've covered a lot of information in a small space, but hopefully you now have
a sense of what is happening inside your computer. The core of a computer is
reasonably simple: the CPU reads data from memory, works with it, and then
writes the result back. That workflow is the foundation that all of Computer
Science is built on.

We already have some tools to build on this foundation. Imagine if you wanted to
store pictures, music, or video on your computer. After our brief dive into
types, we know that we just need a method to convert that data into binary to start
working with it. And those methods already exist. We can store images as PNGs, JPEGs,
TIFFs, PDFs, or many other types. We can store audio as WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or
FLAC. We can store video as WMV, MP4, AVI, or MOV. All of these are simply
descriptions of how to translate information into charged and uncharged circuits
in memory.

We can even build further. If we can send a 1 and 0 from one computer to
another, then we can transfer any information we want. The first computer would
send a value from memory one bit at a time, and the second computer would
reconstruct it on the other end.

The easiest way to send a signal like this is with electricity. A computer
sending an electric signal can either send a signal with high voltage or low
voltage. The receiver then just reads high voltage as 1 and low voltage as 0.
So we just connect two computers with a wire, give them a little bit of hardware
to convert 1's and 0's to electric signals and back again, and we can suddenly
share any data we want.

As you add more computers it becomes difficult to continue connecting them with
wires. So wireless technologies were developed that allow computers to send the
same signals without requiring a physical connection.

So now imagine you have a video or song on one computer, but want to play it on
another. The first computer has the data stored as 1's and 0's; it converts that
data into wireless signals and sends them to the second computer. The second
computer receives the wireless signal, converts it back into 1's and 0's, and
then reads it using one of the video or audio formats.

That's the entire concept of streaming built on two simple ideas. First, if we can
translate information in 1's and 0's, then the computer can understand it.
Second, if we can send 1's and 0's between computers, then we can transfer
information between them.

There are plenty of complications between where you are now and writing your own
music streaming service. However, you now have the tools to form at least a
basic understanding of most programs.

## Where to Go From Here?

If you are interested in learning more, there are many roads open to you.

### Python

If your goal is to start programming and building things as quickly as possible,
you can jump ahead to some of the modern programming languages that handle a lot
of the complexity for you.

Languages like Python have more guard rails to help you avoid errors in your
program and more built-in tools that allow you to focus on what you are building
instead of programming quirks.

### Bash (Systems Admin)

There is much more to learn about the file system and how your computer works
day to day. This is less about programming and more about managing and
operating your computer.

People who do this kind of work are frequently called Systems Administrators,
and it is their job to manage security, what software is installed, and general
configuration.

### C

If you want to keep digging deeper, we need to write a bit of C. We've seen a
bit of how C works, but we need to write some C to see how it breaks. Most
modern languages are built as solutions to specific problems in C. But until you
are forced to deal with those issues, you probably won't be interested in their
solutions.

### Theory

The final path is not really about programming or dealing with day to day
operations of the computer. Instead it's about what a computer could do with the
right hardware, or about how to improve our current usage of computers.

People were thinking about these problems before the first computers were even
built, and they continue to think about them today. The solutions to these
problems often pop up in unexpected places and are useful outside of Computer
Science.
