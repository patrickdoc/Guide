            <h2 id="a-few-new-tools">A Few New Tools</h2>
<p>Three new commands should be enough to get us started:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="bu">pwd</span> - print name of current/working directory</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span class="fu">ls</span>  - list directory contents</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a><span class="bu">cd</span>  - change working directory</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Go ahead and run the first two in your terminal by typing <code>pwd</code> followed by enter/return, and then <code>ls</code> followed by enter/return.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">pwd</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span class="ex">/home/patrick</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span class="ex">Applications</span>  Documents  Pictures</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a><span class="ex">Desktop</span>       Downloads  projects</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Your output will likely not match mine exactly, since this will be specific to each individual computer.</p>
<p>Now try <code>cd &lt;directory&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> is one of the names printed out by the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span class="ex">Applications</span>  Documents  Pictures</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a><span class="ex">Desktop</span>       Downloads  projects</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> Pictures</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>$ <span class="bu">pwd</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a><span class="ex">/home/patrick/Pictures</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span class="ex">Screenshot.png</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, what you see will almost certainly be different than this.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>You can use just a plain <code>cd</code> to go back to the beginning.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a><span class="ex">Applications</span>  Documents  Pictures</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span class="ex">Desktop</span>       Downloads  projects</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="the-file-system">The File System</h2>
<p>When you turn your computer off and then back on again, you'll typically find that not much has changed.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Some apps might have closed that you were using before shutting down, but most everything else was saved.</p>
<p>We take this for granted now, but there was a time when this wasn't true.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Every time the computer was started, it would be effectively empty, and you would have to start completely from scratch.</p>
<p>There are two pieces that implement this functionality.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The first is your hard drive.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>This is the physical equipment inside your computer that stores the data.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The second, which we will be focusing on, is the file system.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>This is the system that organizes all your data into an easily accessible format.</p>
<p>The three commands we just learned about (<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>) are all used for investigating and navigating the file system.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span><code>pwd</code> tells us where we currently are, <code>ls</code> tells us what is around us, and <code>cd</code> moves us.</p>
<p>As an exercise and to help you get to know your computer, I would recommend trying to map out a bit of your file system onto paper.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Here is an example of what it might look like,</p>
<pre><code>                           /home/patrick
                                 |
     ------------------------------------------------------
    /            |         |           |          |        \
Applications  Desktop   Documents  Downloads  Pictures  projects
                                                  |
                                            Screenshot.png</code></pre>
<p>If you lose track of where you are or have reached a dead end, you can always use <code>cd</code> by itself to reset to the beginning.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>If you try <code>cd Screenshot.png</code> and it says <code>Not a directory</code>, you can simply mark that as a dead end.</p>
<p>If you've spent a fair amount of time on this computer, you may start to recognize pieces of the file system.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>For example, if you are using a Mac or Linux and <code>cd Desktop</code>, you'll find that the output of <code>ls</code> matches what you see on your Desktop.</p>
<p>Similarly, you might look under <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Downloads</code> and see some familiar things.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>This is helpful because it means you already know about some parts of the file system.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Soon you'll have a fuller picture and will be able to connect the pieces you know about to the new ones.</p>
