            <p><span class="sentence">We’ve covered a lot of information in a small space, but hopefully you now have a sense of what is happening inside your computer.</span> <span class="sentence">The core of a computer is reasonably simple: the CPU reads data from memory, works with it, and then writes the result back.</span> <span class="sentence">That workflow is the foundation that all of Computer Science is built on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We already have some tools to build on this foundation.</span> <span class="sentence">Imagine if you wanted to store pictures, music, or video on your computer.</span> <span class="sentence">After our brief dive into types, we know that we just need a method to convert that data into binary to start working with it.</span> <span class="sentence">And those methods already exist.</span> <span class="sentence">We can store images as PNGs, JPEGs, TIFFs, PDFs, or many other types.</span> <span class="sentence">We can store audio as WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or FLAC.</span> <span class="sentence">We can store video as WMV, MP4, AVI, or MOV.</span> <span class="sentence">All of these are simply descriptions of how to translate information into charged and uncharged circuits in memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We can even build further.</span> <span class="sentence">If we can send a 1 and 0 from one computer to another, then we can transfer any information we want.</span> <span class="sentence">The first computer would send a value from memory one bit at a time, and the second computer would reconstruct it on the other end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">The easiest way to send a signal like this is with electricity.</span> <span class="sentence">A computer sending an electric signal can either send a signal with high voltage or low voltage.</span> <span class="sentence">The receiver then just reads high voltage as 1 and low voltage as 0.</span> <span class="sentence">So we just connect two computers with a wire, give them a little bit of hardware to convert 1’s and 0’s to electric signals and back again, and we can suddenly share any data we want.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">As you add more computers it becomes difficult to continue connecting them with wires.</span> <span class="sentence">So wireless technologies were developed that allow computers to send the same signals without requiring a physical connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">So now imagine you have a video or song on one computer, but want to play it on another.</span> <span class="sentence">The first computer has the data stored as 1’s and 0’s; it converts that data into wireless signals and sends them to the second computer.</span> <span class="sentence">The second computer receives the wireless signal, converts it back into 1’s and 0’s, and then reads it using one of the video or audio formats.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">That’s the entire concept of streaming built on two simple ideas.</span> <span class="sentence">First, if we can translate information in 1’s and 0’s, then the computer can understand it.</span> <span class="sentence">Second, if we can send 1’s and 0’s between computers, then we can transfer information between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">There are plenty of complications between where you are now and writing your own music streaming service.</span> <span class="sentence">However, you now have the tools to form at least a basic understanding of most programs.</span></p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to Go From Here?</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">If you are interested in learning more, there are many roads open to you.</span></p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p><span class="sentence">If your goal is to start programming and building things as quickly as possible, you can jump ahead to some of the modern programming languages that handle a lot of the complexity for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Languages like Python have more guard rails to help you avoid errors in your program and more built-in tools that allow you to focus on what you are building instead of programming quirks.</span></p>
<h3 id="bash-systems-admin">Bash (Systems Admin)</h3>
<p><span class="sentence">There is much more to learn about the file system and how your computer works day to day.</span> <span class="sentence">This is less about programming and more about managing and operating your computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">People who do this kind of work are frequently called Systems Administrators, and it is their job to manage security, what software is installed, and general configuration.</span></p>
<h3 id="c">C</h3>
<p><span class="sentence">If you want to keep digging deeper, we need to write a bit of C.</span> <span class="sentence">We’ve seen a bit of how C works, but we need to write some C to see how it breaks.</span> <span class="sentence">Most modern languages are built as solutions to specific problems in C.</span> <span class="sentence">But until you are forced to deal with those issues, you probably won’t be interested in their solutions.</span></p>
<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>
<p><span class="sentence">The final path is not really about programming or dealing with day to day operations of the computer.</span> <span class="sentence">Instead it’s about what a computer could do with the right hardware, or about how to improve our current usage of computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">People were thinking about these problems before the first computers were even built, and they continue to think about them today.</span> <span class="sentence">The solutions to these problems often pop up in unexpected places and are useful outside of Computer Science.</span></p>
