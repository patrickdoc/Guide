            <p>We will occasionally need to take brief detours into Computer Science history to provide a bit of context.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Computer Science moves quickly but is only around 100 years old, so we don’t need to dive deep.</p>
<p>Let’s rewind to 1980.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>My dad was in college and taking a class in Computer Science.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The school only had one computer, a “mainframe”, that everyone had to share.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>My dad’s classwork had to be written down on paper and then punched out one line at a time on punch cards.</p>
<p>These punch cards were an existing mechanism used in textile manufacturing.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>A device called Jacquard’s loom used these cards to describe complex weaving instructions for intricate designs.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Adapting punch cards for use in computers was a natural transition.</p>
<p>A punch card is a stiff piece of paper with a grid drawn on it.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>In programming, each column represents one letter based on which combination of holes you punched out.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Whenever you wanted to move to a new line, you simply moved to a new punch card.</p>
<p>When you finished punching out your program, you stacked it on the “input” side of the computer.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The computer would then run, pulling in your cards and processing them one by one.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>When it was done, it would punch out an answer on a new card and print it out to the “output” side.</p>
<p>This process was tedious, full of errors, and required waiting up to a day for your turn.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>It was unpleasant enough that my dad decided not to pursue programming.</p>
<p>But two solutions were coming.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>First, engineers adapted telegraph technology so that text could be sent from a typewriter, over a wire, to the computer instead of using punch cards.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Second, programmers added support for multiple connections to the mainframe at the same time.</p>
<p>By combining these two ideas, they drastically improved the usability of computers.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Instead of waiting in line to submit punch cards, users now sat down at one of the open “terminals” connected to the mainframe.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The terminals had a keyboard for sending instructions to the computer and a screen for displaying the output of the instructions.</p>
<p>Around the same time, “graphical user interfaces”, or GUIs, were being developed for personal computers.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The GUI abandoned the text-based interface of terminals in favor of the mouse and keyboard interface that you are probably more familiar with.</p>
<p>But programmers didn’t abandon their terminals for GUIs.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Instead they simply built apps inside the GUIs that worked just like the terminals they were more familiar with.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>So now we have the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the average user doesn’t know the terminal interface exists.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>It’s a powerful tool, but you are unlikely to discover it on your own.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>You are even less likely to understand what to do with once you see it.</p>
<p>Finding the app seems like a good place to start.</p>
<h2 id="opening-a-terminal">Opening a Terminal</h2>
<p>Modern usage of the word “terminal” generally refers to the app, instead of the machines that were used to connect to mainframes.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>I will stick to that convention.</p>
<p>Note: I am going to do my best to avoid machine-specific instructions.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>But computer designers all put the terminal in slightly different places, so we’ll need to work to find them.</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>If you are on a Linux machine, you’ll have to dig around a bit.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>You might try looking for an app that has <code>&gt;_</code> in the icon.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Alternatively, it will probably be named something that is close to “terminal” or “console”.</p>
<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
<p>If you are on a Mac, you are looking for an application called “Terminal”.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>It is buried in the <code>Applications</code> folder, so it might be easiest to just do a search for it.</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>If you are on Windows, you will have to do a little more work.</p>
<p>Windows is different enough from Mac/Linux that it doesn’t have the terminal built into it.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Luckily for us, they added a feature called “Windows Subsystem for Linux”, that lets you run an app that works just like a Linux computer.</p>
<p>Follow the official Microsoft documentation here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a></p>
<p>I would recommend installing the “Debian GNU/Linux” distro from the Microsoft Store because that will be closest to what I am using.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>However, you can choose whichever you would like.</p>
<h2 id="saying-hello">Saying Hello</h2>
<p>With a terminal window open, we can start with a basic introduction.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>First we ask the computer its name, by typing the command <code>hostname</code> and pressing enter.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">hostname</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span class="ex">fearow</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we can ask the computer what it knows about us,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">whoami</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span class="ex">patrick</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of both of these commands will likely be different for every person.</p>
<p>You can also ask the computer for the date,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">date</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span class="ex">Sun</span> 03 May 2020 05:22:28 PM CDT</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Examples are not terribly helpful for understanding how you can use the terminal though.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>It’s a bit like trying to explain how you can use a pencil by writing down a few different words on paper.</p>
<p>Our main usage of the terminal is going to be to ask the computer prying questions so that we can understand how it works.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Our first line of questioning will be about where it keeps all your data when it is turned off.</p>
