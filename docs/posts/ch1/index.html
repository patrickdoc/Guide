            <p><span class="sentence">My mom used to be a banker.</span> <span class="sentence">Once, while working at the bank, she discovered something fishy in the books and caught a thief who was cheating the system.</span> <span class="sentence">On Friday nights, he would deposit the same check at three different banks.</span> <span class="sentence">The banks were too slow to actually transfer the money, but all three pretended they had it over the weekend and gave him interest for it.</span> <span class="sentence">Monday morning he would withdraw the checks (a few percent richer) before the banks knew what happened.</span> <span class="sentence">My mom figured out what he was doing and tracked down all his fraudulent checks to turn him in to the bank officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">While my mom did catch the thief in the end, if the banks had tried to transfer the money, they would have caught him immediately.</span> <span class="sentence">But he knew the banks couldn’t keep up on Friday nights.</span> <span class="sentence">At some point, employees have to go home even if all the work isn’t done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Luckily for the banks, a solution was coming on the market around the same time.</span> <span class="sentence">Computers.</span> <span class="sentence">Unlike most employees on Friday nights, computers are both fast and accurate.</span> <span class="sentence">They also don’t eat or sleep or take breaks, making them perfect for staying ahead of the thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">When my mom’s bank decided to purchase their first computer, they chose her to help the programmer create the software.</span> <span class="sentence">Her task was to explain her work to the programmer; the programmer’s task was to translate that into instructions for the computer.</span> <span class="sentence">She didn’t know anything about computers; he didn’t know anything about banking; and, together, they wrote software.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">The programmer’s task was hard.</span> <span class="sentence">There weren’t many rules at that time, either for computers or for programming.</span> <span class="sentence">The engineers who designed the computers and the programmers writing software for them were just starting to learn the best ways to work together.</span> <span class="sentence">There were very few standards, so software written for one computer was unlikely to work on another.</span> <span class="sentence">The programmer had to start from scratch with every project.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Fast-forward a few decades to the present: I currently have the same job as that programmer who worked with my mom.</span> <span class="sentence">I don’t work at a bank, but it’s a similar business.</span> <span class="sentence">I don’t work with my mom (unfortunately), but I do work with a business expert.</span> <span class="sentence">She doesn’t know anything about computers; I don’t know anything about the business; and, together, we write software.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">The process hasn’t changed much, but computers have.</span> <span class="sentence">Computers were just starting to gain a foothold in industry when my mom worked with that programmer, but now they are critical to most businesses.</span> <span class="sentence">Computers have moved into our offices, schools, homes, and even pockets.</span> <span class="sentence">They are now part of our daily lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Programming has also changed.</span> <span class="sentence">Programmers and computer engineers recognized the problems they were facing and devoted time and energy to solve them.</span> <span class="sentence">Standards were created so that we don’t have to think about the details of the computers running our code.</span> <span class="sentence">Online forums were designed so that we can share and lookup solutions to common problems.</span> <span class="sentence">Templates were developed so that we only have to fill in the details of our projects without thinking about all the basic pieces required for a program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Programmers continue to make computers smarter and easier to use every day.</span> <span class="sentence">But to truly take advantage of all that work, we have to take a big leap.</span> <span class="sentence">We have to remove the programmer from the equation by giving everyone else the tools to work with the computer directly.</span> <span class="sentence">Instead of having a programmer act as translator between the user and the computer, we need to encourage users to try it for themselves.</span> <span class="sentence">We’ve come a long way from where we started, and we’re as ready as we will ever be for everyone to start trying it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">This is my contribution to the effort.</span> <span class="sentence">I want to give you two things: first, an introduction to computer science and programming; second, a guide to where you could go next.</span> <span class="sentence">The basic knowledge you need to start programming is small, but it’s all you need.</span> <span class="sentence">You can quit after that and go pursue other interests with at least some basic programming skills.</span> <span class="sentence">Or you could continue on a little bit more if you expect to be programming regularly.</span> <span class="sentence">If you find that you really enjoy this material, you can also continue on to more advanced topics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">No matter how long you stick around though, when you leave make sure to keep an eye out for places to use what you know.</span> <span class="sentence">For one, you’ll be surprised by what you can do.</span> <span class="sentence">But also, programmers would love to help if they knew you needed it.</span> <span class="sentence">Members of the community regularly ask around to see what people are working on and if they can lend a hand.</span> <span class="sentence">So don’t be shy, we’re always open to new ideas.</span></p>
