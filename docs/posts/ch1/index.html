            <p>My mom used to be a banker.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>One time, while working at the bank, she discovered something fishy in the books and caught a thief who was cheating the system.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>On Friday nights, he would deposit the same check at three different banks.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The banks were too slow to actually transfer the money, but all three pretended they had it over the weekend and gave him interest for it.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Monday morning he would withdraw the checks -- plus interest -- before the banks knew what happened.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>My mom tracked down all the fraudulent checks he deposited to prove what he was doing.</p>
<p>If the banks had tried to transfer the money, they would have caught the thief immediately.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>But they never did because the thief was moving faster than they could.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>At some point, employees have to go home even if all the work isn't done.</p>
<p>Luckily for the banks, a solution was coming on the market around the same time.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Computers.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Unlike most employees on Friday nights, computers are both fast and accurate.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>They also don't eat or sleep or take breaks, making them perfect for staying ahead of the thieves.</p>
<p>When my mom's bank decided to purchase their first computer, they asked her to work with a programmer to create the software.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Her task was to explain her work to the programmer; the programmer's task was to translate that into instructions for the computer.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>She didn't know anything about computers; he didn't know anything about banking; and, together, they wrote software.</p>
<p>The programmer's task was hard.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>There weren't many rules at that time, either for computers or for programming.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The engineers who designed the computers and the programmers writing software for them were just starting to learn the best ways to work together.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>There were very few standards, so software written for one computer was unlikely to work on another.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The programmer had to start from scratch with every project.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few decades to the present: I currently have the same job as that programmer who worked with my mom.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>I don't work at a bank, but it's a similar business.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>I don't work with my mom (unfortunately), but I do work with a business expert.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>She doesn't know anything about computers; I don't know anything about the business; and, together, we write software.</p>
<p>The process hasn't changed much, but computers have.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Computers were just starting to gain a foothold in industry when my mom worked with that programmer, but now they are critical to most businesses.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Computers have moved into our offices, schools, homes, and even pockets.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>They are now part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>Programming has also changed.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Programmers and computer engineers recognized the problems they were facing and devoted time and energy to solve them.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Standards were created so that we don't have to think about the details of the computers running our code.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Online forums were designed so that we can share and lookup solutions to common problems.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Templates were developed so that we only have to fill in the details of our projects without thinking about all the basic pieces required for a program.</p>
<p>Programmers continue to make computers smarter and easier to use every day.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>But to truly take advantage of all that work, we have to take a big leap.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>We have to remove the programmer from the equation by giving everyone else the tools to work with the computer directly.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Instead of having a programmer act as translator between the user and the computer, we need to encourage users to try it for themselves.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>We've come a long way from where we started, and we're as ready as we will ever be for everyone to start trying it out.</p>
<p>This is my contribution to the effort.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>I want to give you two things: first, an introduction to computer science and programming; second, a guide to where you could go next.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The basic knowledge you need to start programming is small, but it's all you need.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>You can quit after that and go pursue other interests with at least some basic programming skills.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>Or you could continue on a little bit more if you expect to be programming regularly.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>If you find that you really enjoy this material, you can also continue on to more advanced topics.</p>
<p>No matter how long you stick around though, when you leave make sure to keep an eye out for places to use what you know.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>For one, you'll be surprised by what you can do.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>But also, programmers would love to help if they knew you needed it.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>The community regularly asks around to see what people are working on and if they can lend a hand.<span class="interSentenceSpace"></span>So don't be shy, we're always open to new ideas.</p>
