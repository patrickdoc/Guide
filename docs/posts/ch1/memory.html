                    Volatile Memory

            <p><span class="sentence">The final piece of your computer that we need to cover is “volatile memory”.</span> <span class="sentence">We know from earlier that memory is a term for anything that can store data.</span> <span class="sentence">“Non-volatile” meant that the data was not lost when you turn off your computer.</span> <span class="sentence">“Volatile” means the opposite; the data <em>is</em> lost when you turn off your computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">It may not be immediately clear why we would want volatile memory.</span> <span class="sentence">Choosing between losing your data and not losing your data seems simple.</span> <span class="sentence">However, there is more to this choice than just volatility.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">One drawback to the hard drive that we haven’t seen yet is that it is slow.</span> <span class="sentence">It’s hard to give exact numbers because the technology is constantly improving.</span> <span class="sentence">But if we rewind to roughly the year 2000, we can look at some approximations.</span> <span class="sentence"><a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers">1</a></span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Suppose we wanted to read some data that is already stored in memory.</span> <span class="sentence">In 2000, most people had hard disk drives as their non-volatile memory.</span> <span class="sentence">You could read from these in approximately 20,000,000 nanoseconds.</span> <span class="sentence">In comparison, volatile memory would have only taken 250,000 nanoseconds, 80 times faster.</span> <span class="sentence">The solid state drives that were coming closed the gap significantly, coming in at 1,000,000 nanoseconds, only 4 times slower than volatile memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Rephrased in a more human scale, if reading from volatile memory takes 1 day, then a solid state drive would take 4 days.</span> <span class="sentence">That’s not too bad, but it is noticeable.</span> <span class="sentence">Hard disk drives on the other hand would take 80 days.</span> <span class="sentence">That is a large enough difference that I would do everything I could to use volatile memory.</span></p>
<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">In a perfect world, we would have hardware that provides non-volatile memory and is fast.</span> <span class="sentence">But for now, we are stuck with two separate pieces of hardware: the hard drive, which doesn’t lose data but is slow, and RAM, which is fast but loses data.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">RAM stands for “Random Access Memory”; it is the hardware that provides volatile memory.</span> <span class="sentence">As the name suggests, it is exceptionally good at “random access”.</span> <span class="sentence">Hard drives work best when you read/write data in one spot, such as in a single file.</span> <span class="sentence">But RAM still performs well when you read from one spot, and then write somewhere else, and then read from another random location.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">RAM is our workspace when we are programming.</span> <span class="sentence">We have access to this great big storage space that we can use however we would like to.</span> <span class="sentence">Often we use it to store intermediate results when we are working.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, I was taught to multiply two digit numbers in a multi-step process.</span> <span class="sentence">It looks something like this,</span></p>
<pre><code>  23
x 44
----</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">First, we multiply with the one’s digit of <code>44</code>.</span></p>
<pre><code>  1
  23
x 44
----
  92</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Then we add a <code>0</code> to the second line and multiply with the ten’s digit.</span></p>
<pre><code>  1
  23
x 44
----
  92
 920</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Finally, we add the two results together for the result,</span></p>
<pre><code>  23
x 44
----
  92
+920
----
1012</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">When we are programming, we need some place to put <code>92</code> and <code>920</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">They aren’t part of the result, but they need to be stored somewhere while we are calculating the next steps.</span> <span class="sentence">Once we have the result, the space that held <code>92</code> and <code>920</code> can be cleared and used for something else.</span></p>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p><span class="sentence">Let’s look at one more example which is a bit more complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">When you type a new letter into Vim, what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">One possible implementation would be to update the file on the hard drive every time you type.</span> <span class="sentence">The moment you press <code>e</code> in insert mode, an instruction is sent to the CPU to add an <code>e</code> to the file, and then the CPU sends a request to the hard drive to update the contents of the file.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">This would work, but it could lead to an unpleasant user experience.</span> <span class="sentence">You probably don’t usually notice a lag between pressing a key and seeing it appear on the screen.</span> <span class="sentence">But if Vim had to update the file on the hard drive every time you added or deleted a letter, that lag might become noticeable.</span> <span class="sentence">It might even become so noticeable that you decide to try a different text editor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">An alternative implementation would be to keep the contents of the file in RAM.</span> <span class="sentence">Now when you type an <code>e</code>, instead of sending an instruction through the CPU to the hard drive, it sends an instruction through the CPU to RAM.</span> <span class="sentence">This makes the user experience fast, so you don’t notice any lag between typing and seeing the results on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Our end goal is to modify the file on the hard drive, so we also need a method to update the file with the changes we made in RAM.</span> <span class="sentence">When you enter the <code>:w</code> command, you are asking Vim to “write” the changes from RAM onto the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">This process of moving changes from volatile memory to non-volatile memory is common.</span> <span class="sentence">Although, it is more often called “saving” instead of “writing”.</span> <span class="sentence">You may have seen warnings before that say something like,</span></p>
<pre><code>Are you sure you want to quit without saving? All unsaved progress will be lost.</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">That warning message is trying to tell you that you made changes in volatile memory but did not update the hard drive.</span> <span class="sentence">If you quit without writing or saving, those changes will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">You may have also run into this if your computer lost power while you were working.</span> <span class="sentence">If the power goes out or your battery runs out in the middle of working on something, you may find that the next time you go back your most recent changes are missing.</span> <span class="sentence">This is the same issue.</span> <span class="sentence">Your changes were in volatile memory and were lost when the power went out.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span class="sentence">You imagination is the only limitation on how you use RAM.</span> <span class="sentence">It is your workspace to use however you would like when you are programming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">But there is a twist: RAM can only store 1’s and 0’s.</span> <span class="sentence">An average computer right now can store at least 16 billion 1’s and 0’s, but all that space is worthless if we don’t know how to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We have one hint about how we are going to use it.</span> <span class="sentence">We saw that the computer converted the letter <code>A</code> to the number <code>65</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">If we could somehow convert <code>65</code> into 1’s and 0’s, we would have a way to store the letter <code>A</code> in RAM.</span> <span class="sentence">That wouldn’t explain everything we need to know, but it would at least be a start.</span></p>
