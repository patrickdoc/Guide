            <p><span class="sentence">We’ve seen a little bit about how memory is used and the differences between volatile and non-volatile memory, but we haven’t see much about what memory is.</span> <span class="sentence">When a file is “written” into memory, what does that translate to on the hardware?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">At the smallest scale, a single cell of memory is an electic circuit that can either be charged with electricity or empty.</span> <span class="sentence">When we write to memory, we adjust the state of this circuit by either charging it or discharging it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">You can think of the cell like a light switch, either in the “on” or “off” position.</span> <span class="sentence">When writing, we can flip the switch, and when reading, we can check if the switch is currently on or off.</span> <span class="sentence">Instead of “off” and “on” though, we typically use <code>0</code> to represent the discharged state and <code>1</code> to represent the charged state.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We call a single cell of memory a “bit”, short for “binary digit”.</span> <span class="sentence">Digits are the numbers 0 to 9, but “binary” limits us to only the first two, 0 and 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">If our memory only had one bit, there would only be two possible configurations, <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">But if we add a second bit, we have four possible configurations shown below.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Bit 1 | Bit 2 0 | 0 0 | 1 1 | 0 1 | 1</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">If we add a third bit, we double the number of configurations again for a total of eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Bit 1 | Bit 2 | Bit 3 0 | 0 | 0 0 | 0 | 1 0 | 1 | 0 0 | 1 | 1 1 | 0 | 0 1 | 0 | 1 1 | 1 | 0 1 | 1 | 1</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Each time we add a new bit of memory, we double the number of possible configurations.</span> <span class="sentence">By the time we reach 8 bits, we have 256 different combinations of 0’s and 1’s available to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">A group of 8 bits forms a “byte”, which is our standard unit of memory.</span> <span class="sentence">Like other scientific units, we can use prefixes like “kilo-”, “mega-”, and “giga-” to represent one thousand, one million, and one billion bytes respectively.</span> <span class="sentence">The computer I am working on has 8 gigabytes of memory, which translates to 8 billion bytes or 64 billion bits.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Bytes are the only data that memory understands.</span> <span class="sentence">When we want to write a new letter into a file, it must first be translated into bytes before it is written into memory.</span> <span class="sentence">When we want to open a file, the bytes in memory must be converted back to letters before we can read them.</span></p>
<h2 id="binary">Binary</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">Depending on the data we are trying to translate, we use a few different systems.</span> <span class="sentence">The first system we will look at is “binary”.</span> <span class="sentence">Binary is a system of counting that only uses 0’s and 1’s.</span> <span class="sentence">Our usual system, “decimal”, uses all the digits 0 through 9.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite missing out on 2-9, binary is completely equivalent to decimal, and we can always translate from one system to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Binary may look different at first, but it is reasonably similar to decimal.</span> <span class="sentence">Here are the first 11 numbers in each system,</span></p>
<pre><code>Decimal: 0  1   2   3    4    5    6    7     8     9    10
Binary:  0  1  10  11  100  101  110  111  1000  1001  1010</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Two comparisons might help you understand how binary works.</span> <span class="sentence">First, notice that when we count, we use up all of our single digits, and then add 1 to the left and restart.</span> <span class="sentence">In binary we just run out of digits faster, so we have to start new columns faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Second, notice that 10 and 2 play crucial roles in determining the value of a number.</span> <span class="sentence">Specifically, we can do this in decimal,</span></p>
<pre><code>                            432
=           4 x 100   +    3 x 10   +   2 x 1
=           4 x 10^2  +   3 x 10^1  +  2 x 10^0
=             400     +      30     +     2
=                           432</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Let’s break down a binary number similarly.</span></p>
<pre><code>                            101
=             1 x 4   +    0 x 2    +   1 x 1
=            1 x 2^2  +   0 x 2^1   +  1 x 2^0
=               4     +      0      +     1
=                            5</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">In school, you might have been taught about the “1’s place”, the “10’s place,” and the “100’s place”.</span> <span class="sentence">In binary, you might call them the “1’s place”, “2’s place”, the “4’s place” and so on.</span> <span class="sentence">Each time you can multiply by another copy of the base (2 or 10) to get your value.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Because computer science uses binary so heavily, powers of 2 are useful to know.</span> <span class="sentence">For reference,</span></p>
<pre><code>          2^0 2^1 2^2  2^3   2^4  2^5  2^6 2^7 2^8 2^9 2^10 2^11 2^12
Decimal:    1   2   4    8    16   32   64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096
Binary:     1  10 100 1000 10000 10^5 10^6 ...</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">You don’t need to memorize this chart, but keep an eye out for powers of 2.</span> <span class="sentence">They show up regularly in Computer Science.</span></p>
