## Why a Separate Source?

I want to provide a space for discussion without opening a free comment
section. I welcome and encourage critiques about the site, but I do not
want that to be part of the experience for the reader. Instead, you are
welcome to open issues here where we can freely debate the relative merits
of the content.

This also allows me to keep my opinions mostly out of the site. While I
obviously will be biased in the way I present the material, I am working
to avoid a lot of the garbage that often comes up around these sorts of
topics.

Take, for instance, JavaScript. I have a long list of complaints about it, but
it obviously is a powerful and popular tool. If I were to present it on the
site, I would aim to fairly assess its strengths and weaknesses. However, here
I would feel less inclined to sing its praises. Please call me out if you see
something that is unfair to a language or technology. I am actively working to
avoid it, but I am sure it will slip through sometimes.

I will do my best to write high quality code in every language, but I am not
perfect. If you see code that could be simplified or written more
idiomatically, let me know! There will be times that I deliberately write code
poorly though, so read through to the conclusion before posting here. If you
think that code is more misleading than helpful, let me know!

I really do want to hear from you. I want to create a reliable and thorough
source of information, but I don't know everything. I've written a fair bit of
C code, but even just working to create the intro to C I learned things. Did
you know:

```c
sizeof('a') == sizeof(int)
```

I certainly didn't. I'm sure there are things that I believe that simply
aren't true. I do my best to test the things I say, but I know different
platforms have surprising differences. This repo can be just as useful for
details as the site is for broad topics. Come, share your knowledge!

:)
