# README

First off, welcome! For whatever amount of time you decide to spend here, I hope
you find the experience enjoyable and fruitful.

This site is intended to provide two things. First, a thorough introduction to
all fundamental concepts in computer science. Second, the resources to get
started in any particular field you wish.

I would like to be clear that this is not a programming tutorial.  My goal is to
teach you how computers work. Programming is just a way of using your knowledge
about computers to make them do something. When you look at programs and
programming languages as answers to real problems, the solutions make much more
sense. In fact, many times, you could have come up with these ideas yourself.

I also want this content to be accessible to everyone. Programming is a lot like
language; there are 100 different ways to write. With language, you can write
novels, research papers, poetry, texts, tweets, songs, etc., all of which
require different skills and do different things. Some programs are large,
business oriented monsters, while others are short and do specific little
things. You can create games for phones or control the boosters space shuttles.
You can generate images by manually changing each pixel or you can teach a
machine how to 3d print an object. Even the smallest programs that find the area
of a square or tally up a receipt are useful. Everyone can make something.
