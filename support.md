# Contact and Support

## Support

If you have already supported me, I want to say thank you. Every donation not
only helps me devote time to developing and extending this content, but also
lets me know that this site is helping someone.

If you would like to support me, I accept 

Patreon
bitcoin
ethereum

Patreon is useful for me because it provides some stability in site income. That
means I can spend time more confidently building the site.

I understand if you are not in a position to support me monetarily, but there
are other ways you can help! The best way is just to spread the word, tell your
kids, tell your grandma, tell your neighbors. Social media is also a pretty good
place. Even just an encouraging email helps me out.

## Contact

If you would like to contact me, you can reach me at:

email (at) gmail (dot) com

You'll see emails written like this to help cut down on spam. There are programs
that look all over the internet for email addresses to send random messages to.
You can just use `@` instead of `(at)`, and `.` instead of `(dot)` to get my
real email address. Surprisingly, this tiny adjustment is enough to stop most of
them.

You can contact me about:

- site issues
- content issues
- programming issues
- just about anything you want

I will do my best to reply to you quickly! Please give me some time, but if a
couple days pass without a response, feel free to resend your message.
