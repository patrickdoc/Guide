# Fun

I'm could call this section homework or exercises, but that would make it less
appealing. Instead, I'll call it fun, and you can decide what you think of it.

Below are a variety of different applications we can write with our knowledge
so far. Practice is really the only way to learn anything, so these are meant
to give you space to flex your new brain muscles. There are multiple different
ways people like practicing, so see what suits you best.

The three styles are listed in order of increasing efficiency. That is, the
follow along posts are longer, and work through step by step, while the fill in
is completely up to you. You may find it useful to use the previous styles as
hints for the later ones.

These examples may also include suggestions for further exploration. One of the
best features of programming is that you can be fairly confident that your
programs work just by testing them. Testing is actually a fairly important part
of real code development, so it's good to get practice now.
