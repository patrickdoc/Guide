# Python and the Terminal

Although this section is short, it introduces you to a whole load of new ideas.
These are some of the biggest roadblocks in starting to learn computer science.
By getting over them, we will make everything else a whole lot easier. Don't
worry if everything isn't perfectly clear from the start, I'll try to give you
plenty of practice and refreshers as we go along. There is a lot to learn, but
you have to start somewhere!
